How to run everything:
1. Load all code and data files into a single folder. This project used Jupyter Notebooks, and 
all code files and data files were stored in the same folder. 
2. Run ‘EDA+Standardization’, it will generate merged_geo_df.csv which will be used in the 
regression and ML notebooks. 
3. Once merged_geo_df.csv is created, all the other notebooks can be run without any 
specific sequence. 
4. All notebooks have the Dash app at the bottom for user interaction, however, only one 
notebook can be active at a time. To use the Dash app in another notebook, be sure to shut 
down all other notebooks except the desired notebook
